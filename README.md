# KafkaSnowflake Project
This project implements a simulated real-time data engineering pipeline that generates dummy social media activity data using Python’s Faker library, streams it through Apache Kafka, and persists it into Snowflake for downstream analytics and reporting. The primary goal of this project is to replicate a production-style streaming architecture while working with technologies commonly used by data engineers. It focuses on building an end-to-end pipeline where data flows continuously from the source (generated events) to storage (Snowflake table) in a reliable and scalable way.
